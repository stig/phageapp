=============

I want to implement the game described here:

http://www.theallseeingi.proboards.com/index.cgi?board=fg&action=print&thread=322

* It's currently not available for iOS, to the best of my knowledge.
* There is no trademark issues; its inventor asked me to implement it, and was happy for me to charge for it.


Features
--------

* Single-player mode: Simple AI opponent
* Two-player mode: GameCentre-based. Turn-based games against random opponents / friends

* Universal (iPad / iPhone)

Milestones
----------
