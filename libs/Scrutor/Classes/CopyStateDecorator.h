 @brief Execute the underlying search on a copy of the state.
 
 This decorator is useful if you have observers of the original state and
 don't want it to be temporarily modified during the search for a best move.
 
 In addition to the SBGameTreeNode protocol, your states must
 implement the NSCopying protocol to use this decorator.
