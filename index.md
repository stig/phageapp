Phage is an addictive new two-player abstract strategy game where the
objective is to outmanoeuvre your opponent. If they have no moves left but
you do, you win the match!

Play against friends, or challenge the AI if no-one is around. Matches tend
to be short, but if you run out of time you can always just quit the app and
resume later&mdash;all matches are auto-saved.

How To Play
-----------

### 2 players, 4 pieces and 7 moves

Each player has four pieces and takes turns moving any one of these. Each
piece can be moved seven times; there are no pass moves.

A cell which has been previously occupied by a piece is blocked; it cannot
be occupied again, nor can any piece be moved *across* it in any direction.

All pieces can move across any number of clear cells, but not all pieces
can move in all directions.


**Circle**

moves horizontally, vertically, or diagonally in any direction:
