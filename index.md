Phage is an addictive and unique new iOS game: play against friends, or
challenge the AI if no-one is around. Matches tend to be short, but if
you run out of time you can always just quit the app and resume later;
all matches are auto-saved.

How To Play
-----------

Phage is a two-player game. Each player has four pieces and takes turn
moving any one of these. Each piece can be moved seven times, and there
are no pass moves. A cell which has been previously occupied by a piece
is blocked; it cannot be occupied again, nor can any piece be moved
*across* it in any direction. All pieces can move across any number of
clear cells, but not all pieces can move in all directions.

Circle moves horizontally, vertically, or diagonally in any direction:
