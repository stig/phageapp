Phage is an abstract strategy game for two players. Draws are possible,
and matches tend to be short. At the moment Phage supports:

* 1-player mode against an AI
* 2-player mode for two humans passing a device between them
* Matches are auto-saved so you can quit at any time and come back to finish matches later

Each player takes turn moving one of their four pieces. Each piece can
be moved seven times, and there are no pass moves. A cell which has been
previously occupied by a piece is blocked; it cannot be occupied again,
nor can any piece be moved *across* it in any direction.

# How to Play

Phage is a two-player abstract strategy game. Matches tend to be
short, and draws are possible.

**To play, simply tap one of your pieces to select it; then tap the
location you want to move it to.**

Each player takes turn moving one of their four pieces. Each piece can
be moved a maximum of seven times. There are no pass moves.

A cell which has been previously occupied by a piece is blocked; it
cannot be occupied again, nor can any piece be moved *across* it in any
direction.

The pieces can move across any number of blank cells, but they move in
different ways:

**Circle** moves horizontally, vertically, or diagonally in any direction.
