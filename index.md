Phage is an abstract strategy game for two players. Draws are possible,
and matches tend to be short. At the moment Phage supports:

* 1-player mode against an AI
* 2-player mode for two humans passing a device between them
* Matches are auto-saved so you can quit at any time and come back to finish matches later

Each player takes turn moving one of their four pieces. Each piece can
be moved seven times, and there are no pass moves. A cell which has been
previously occupied by a piece is blocked; it cannot be occupied again,
nor can any piece be moved *across* it in any direction.
