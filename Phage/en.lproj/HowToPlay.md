How To Play
===========

Phage is a two-player abstract strategy game not entirely unlike chess.
Players alternate moving until the current player cannot make a move. If
the opponent can still move at this point he or she wins the game,
otherwise it's a draw.

Each player has four pieces (Circle, Square, Diamond & Triangle) that can
be moved a maximum of seven times each. (For this reason, games tend to be short.)

The pieces move in different ways:

- Circle moves horizontally, vertically and diagonally in any direction.
  (Like Queens in Chess.)
- Square moves diagonally in any direction. (Like Bishops in Chess.)
- Diamond moves horizontally and vertically in any direction. (Like
  Rooks in Chess.)
- Triangle moves horizontally in any direction, and vertically *in the
  direction of its point*. This piece has no direct equivalents in Chess.

A square which has been previously occupied by a piece is blocked. It
cannot be occupied again, nor can any piece be moved *across* it in any
direction.
