Phage is a two-player abstract strategy game with similarities to Chess,
though matches tend to be much shorter.

Each player takes turn moving one of their four pieces. Each piece can
be moved seven times. There are no pass moves. Draws are possible.

The pieces can move across any number of blank cells, but they move in different ways:

**Circle** can move horizontally, vertically, or diagonally in any direction.

**Square** can move diagonally in any direction.

**Triangle** can move horizontally in any direction, and vertically *in the direction it points*.

**Blocked cells**

A cell which has been previously occupied by a piece is blocked; it
cannot be occupied again, nor can any piece be moved *across* it in any
direction.


**Performing a move**

Tap a piece to select it, then tap the location you want to move it to.
