Phage
=====

A two-player abstract strategy game with similarities to chess.

Game Mechanics
--------------

Each of the players take turn moving one of their pieces until a player
runs out of legal moves. The player that performs the most moves wins.
Draws are possible.

Each player has four pieces: Circle, Square, Diamond & Triangle. Each
can be moved a maximum of seven times. Thus, games tend to be short.
There are no pass moves. The pieces move in different ways:

- Circle moves horizontally, vertically and diagonally in any direction.
  (Like Queens in Chess.)
- Square moves diagonally in any direction. (Like Bishops in Chess.)
- Diamond moves horizontally and vertically in any direction. (Like
  Rooks in Chess.)
- Triangle moves horizontally in any direction, and vertically *in the
  direction of its point*. This piece has no direct equivalents in Chess.

A cell which has been previously occupied by a piece is blocked. It
cannot be occupied again, nor can any piece be moved *across* it in any
direction.

Performing a move
-----------------

Tap a piece to select it; it should start gently pulsing. Tap it again
to reveal its legal destinations, or just tap the location you want to
move it to.

Alternatively, drag and drop one of your pieces to a new destination.
You can even tap a piece twice to reveal its legal destinations before
dragging.
