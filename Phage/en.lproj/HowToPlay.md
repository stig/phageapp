How To Play
===========

Phage is a two-player abstract strategy game with some similarities to
chess. Each player take turn moving one of their pieces until they run
out of moves. The player that can perform the most moves wins. Draws are
possible.

Each player has four pieces: Circle, Square, Diamond & Triangle. Each
piece can only be moved seven times. Thus, games tend to be short. There
are no pass moves. The pieces move in different ways:

- Circle moves horizontally, vertically and diagonally in any direction.
  (Like Queens in Chess.)
- Square moves diagonally in any direction. (Like Bishops in Chess.)
- Diamond moves horizontally and vertically in any direction. (Like
  Rooks in Chess.)
- Triangle moves horizontally in any direction, and vertically *in the
  direction of its point*. (This piece has no direct equivalent in Chess.)

A cell which has been previously occupied by a piece is blocked. It
cannot be occupied again, nor can any piece be moved *across* it in any
direction.

Performing a move
-----------------

Tap a piece to select it, then tap the location you want to move it to.
Double-tap to select a piece and its legal destinations will be
highlighted. Tap/double-tap a different piece to select that one
instead. Alternatively, long-press a piece to pick it up and drag it
where you want it.
