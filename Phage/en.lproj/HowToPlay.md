Phage is a two-player abstract strategy game where the objective is to
outmanoeuvre your opponent. If they have no legal moves left but you do,
you win the match.

Matches tend to be short, but if you run out of time you can always just
quit the app and resume later&mdash;all matches are auto-saved.

**To play, simply tap one of your pieces to select it, then tap the
location you want to move it to.**

Each player has four pieces and takes turns moving any one of these.
Each piece can be moved seven times; there are no pass moves. A cell
which has been previously occupied by a piece is blocked; it cannot be
occupied again, nor can any piece be moved *across* it in any direction.

All pieces can move across any number of clear cells, but not all pieces
can move in all directions.

**Circle** moves horizontally, vertically, or diagonally in any direction.
