Phage is a two-player abstract strategy game. Matches tend to be
short, and draws are possible.

**To play, simply tap one of your pieces to select it; then tap the
location you want to move it to.**

Each player takes turn moving one of their four pieces. Each piece can
be moved a maximum of seven times. There are no pass moves.

A cell which has been previously occupied by a piece is blocked; it
cannot be occupied again, nor can any piece be moved *across* it in any
direction.

The pieces can move across any number of blank cells, but they move in
different ways:

**Circle** moves horizontally, vertically, or diagonally in any direction.
