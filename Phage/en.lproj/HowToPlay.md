How To Play
===========

Phage is a two-player abstract strategy game with some similarities to
Chess. Each player take turn moving one of their pieces until they run
out of moves. The player that can perform the most moves wins. Draws are
possible.

Each player has four pieces: Circle, Square, Diamond & Triangle. These
moves similarly to Queens, Bishops and Rooks. (Triangle has no direct
equivalent piece in Chess.) Each piece can only be moved seven times.
Thus, games tend to be short. There are no pass moves. The pieces move
in different ways:

- Circle moves horizontally, vertically and diagonally in any direction.
- Square moves diagonally in any direction.
- Diamond moves horizontally and vertically in any direction.
- Triangle moves horizontally in any direction, and vertically *in the
  direction it points*.

A cell which has been previously occupied by a piece is blocked. It
cannot be occupied again, nor can any piece be moved *across* it in any
direction.

Performing a move
-----------------

Tap a piece to select it, then tap the location you want to move it to.
Double-tap to select a piece and its legal destinations will be
highlighted. Tap/double-tap a different piece to select that one
instead. Alternatively, long-press a piece to pick it up and drag it
where you want it.
