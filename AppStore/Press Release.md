# Phage 1.0 for iOS is available!

Phage is an addictive new two-player abstract strategy game where the objective is to outmanoeuvre your opponent. If they have no legal moves left but you do, you win the match.

Play against friends, or challenge the AI if no-one is around. Matches tend to be short, but if you run out of time you can always just quit the app and resume laterâ€”all matches are auto-saved.

Features:
* 1-player match against AI
* 2-player match (pass to play)
* Save & resume any match
* iPhone5 ready!

Phage 1.0 is available for immediate release from the iOS AppStore:
